    "Montezuma II": "(c. 1466–1520) was one of the last rulers of theAztec empire. In 1519 Montezuma allowed armed forces led by the SpanishconquistadorHernán Cortésto enter the Aztec capital,Tenochtitlán. Several months later, the SpanishimprisonedMontezuma within his own palace. After the conquistadorPedro de Alvaradotook advantage of Montezuma’s captivity tomassacre peaceful celebrants at a religious festival, the Aztecs selected a new ruler namedCuitláhuac, and the city erupted into conflicts that led to Montezuma’s death. The Spanish then fled during an escape that is called the“Noche Triste,”or “Sad Night” because many conquistadors died while crossing the causeways that connected the island city Tenochtitlán to the shores ofLake Texcoco. By 1521, the ravages ofsmallpoxand the help of indigenousTlaxcalanallies allowed Cortés to conquer Tenochtitlán and to captureCuauhtémoc, the final Aztec emperor.",
    "Miguel Hidalgo": "(1753–1811) was a parishpriestwho became theleader of Mexico’s first independence movement. AfterNapoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsulain 1808 and ousted the Spanish king Ferdinand VII, political movements advocating Enlightenment ideas ofrepresentative governmentandlocal self-determinationsprung up in many of Spain’s American colonies. Hidalgo belonged to one such group, which officials in the viceroyalty ofNew Spainattempted to suppress. In response, Hidalgo called his congregation together and issued a call forrevoltknown as the“Grito de Dolores,”or “Cry of Dolores” on September 16, 1810. The rebels captured the citiesGuanajuatoandGuadalajara, but wereunable to take Mexico City. In 1811, Hidalgo was captured andexecutedby the colonial regime. The leadership of the independence movement then fell to another priest namedJosé María Morelos, who was himself executed in 1815. Although Hidalgo’s movement was unsuccessful, September 16 is still celebrated as Mexico’s official Day of Independence.",
    "Agustín de Iturbide": "(1783–1824) was aroyalist generalwho changed his allegiances to become thefirst ruler of independent Mexico. Like manyCreoles, or people of European descent born in the Americas, Iturbide feared that the insurgency would upsetcolonial hierarchies of race and class. In 1820, however, aliberal revolution in Spaincaused conservative Mexican elites to reconsider the benefits of independence. Iturbide reached out to the insurgent leaderVicente Guerrero, and agreed to endorselegal racial equalityin exchange for Guerrero’s military support. Early in 1821 Iturbide released thePlan of Iguala, which is also known as the “Plan of the Three Guarantees” or “Plan Trigarante” because it called forMexican independence, a whollyCatholic state, and theequality of all races. Iturbide’s Army of the Three Guarantees soon forcedJuan O’Donoju, the last viceroy of New Spain, to acknowledge Mexican independence in theTreaty of Córdoba. In 1822 Iturbide became thefirst emperor of Mexico, but a revolt led byAntonio López de Santa Annaforced Iturbide intoexilein 1823. When Iturbide returned to Mexico in 1824, he was quicklyexecuted.",
    "Antonio López de Santa Anna": "(1794–1876) was a general who served aspresident of Mexico eleven different timesbetween 1833 and 1855. After gaining independence, many Latin American nations fell under the rule ofcaudillos, or charismatic leaders who exercised bothmilitary and political power. As one of these figures, Santa Anna cultivated an image of himself as asaviorof the Mexican nation, and even held an elaborate funeral for theleg that he lost during a conflict with Franceknown as the“Pastry War.”However, Santa Anna proved unable to prevent the loss of Mexico’s northern territories. Despite routing the defenders of theAlamo, Santa Anna was defeated by the forces of Sam Houston at the 1836Battle of San Jacinto, and was forced to recognizeTexan independence. A little more than a decade later, Santa Anna seized control of the government during theMexican-American War, only to lose major battles atCerro GordoandChapultepec, and be forced intoexile. He returned to Mexico in 1853 and tried to establish apermanent dictatorship, but was challenged by theLiberal Plan of Ayutla, and was driven from power in 1855.",
    "Benito Juárez": "(1806–1872) was aLiberallawyerwho became thefirst indigenous president of Mexico, and who led the opposition to the French-backed empire ofMaximilian von Habsburg. Born to aZapotecfamily in the state ofOaxaca, Juárez became a key figure in the Liberal movement thatdeposed Santa Anna, and which initiated legal and social changes known asLa Reforma(“the Reform”). An 1855 law named after Juárez sought toeliminate special privilegesgiven to members of the church and military, and was incorporated into anew constitutionratified in 1857. Conservative backlash soon led to theWar of the Reform, which lasted from 1857 to 1861, and left the victorious Liberals with little money in the national treasury. France’s emperorNapoleon IIIthen used Mexico’sforeign debtsto as a pretext for an invasion known as the“French Intervention,”which briefly imposed the Austrian archdukeMaximilianas Mexico’s second emperor. As the elected president of Mexico, Juárezevaded captureby French and imperial troops while rallying Republican forces. After the departure of the French, Liberal troops captured andexecutedMaximilian on theHill of the Bellsin the city ofQuerétaro. Juárez returned to Mexico City, and remained president until his death.",
    "Porfirio Díaz": "(1830–1915) was aLiberalgeneralwho established a long-lastingdictatorshipthat eventually led to theMexican Revolution. In 1876 Díaz issued thePlan of Tuxtepecand seized power from the Liberal presidentSebastián Lerdo de Tejada. Díaz then dominated Mexican politics for the next 35 years, and served as president continuously between 1884 and 1911 despite his earlier use of the slogan“Effective Suffrage and No Re-Election.”While in office, Díaz skillfullymanipulatedfederal, state, and local politics,suppressed dissent, tamed the fractiousMexican army, opened Mexico toforeign investment, and oversaw the beginnings of the country’sindustrial development. His supporters praised him as a brilliant statesman who had ended the upheavals of the mid-nineteenth century; his detractors stressed the inequality, corruption, and systematic brutality of the political and economic systems fostered by Díaz and hispositivist advisors, who were known asCientíficos. In 1908 Díaz discussed the possibility of his resignation during an interview with the American journalistJames Creelman, which helped open the door toelectoral mobilization, and eventually toarmed rebellion. TheAnti-Reelectionistforces ofFrancisco Maderorevolted in 1910 and won their first victories in 1911, sparking uprisings elsewhere in the country. Díaz promptly resigned under terms stipulated in theTreaty of Ciudad Juárez, and spent the last years of his life in comfortableEuropean exile.",
    "Francisco Madero": "(1873–1913) led the 1910revolution against Porfirio Díaz, and served as president of Mexico from 1911 to 1913. As theidealisticson of awealthy Coahuilanfamily, Madero was in some ways an unlikely revolutionary. However, Madero’s idealism allowed him to challenge Díaz with a boldness that more powerful politicians and generals had lacked. After theCreelman interviewwas released, Madero wrote a book titledThe Presidential Succession in 1910, which argued that it was time for Díaz to be replaced, and which revived Díaz’s former slogan,“Effective Suffrage and No Re-Election.”Madero then ran for president, but wasarrestedbefore the election. Afterescaping from prison, Madero issued thePlan of San Luis Potosí, which called for ageneral revoltin November 1910. Dissatisfaction with the Díaz regime coalesced around Madero, who unseated the dictator and took power after democratic elections were held in the fall of 1911. However, Madero was unable to satisfy the far-reaching demands of the diverse coalition that had brought him to power. Madero was also disliked by the American ambassadorHenry Lane Wilsonand by former supporters of the Díaz regime, many of whom retained their positions in the government and army. In February 1913, Wilson encouraged GeneralVictoriano Huertato participate in acoupagainst Madero. After a period of fighting within Mexico City that is known as theDecena Trágica, or Tragic Ten Days, Madero was forced toresign. Huerta became president, and Madero was murdered a few days later.",
    "Venustiano Carranza": "(1859–1920) was the“First Chief” of the Constitutionalist armyduring theMexican Revolution, and president of Mexico from 1917 to 1920. After the death ofFrancisco Madero, Carranza issued thePlan of Guadalupe, and became the nucleus of opposition toVictoriano Huerta’s regime. Carranza’s movement was supported by the generalsPablo González,Álvaro Obregón, andPancho Villa, who assembled armies in northern Mexico and pushed south to the capital. The southern generalEmiliano Zapataalso allied with Carranza to remove Huerta from power. After Huerta was forced to resign in 1914, members of Carranza’s movement held a convention in the city ofAguascalientes. The convention formed a new government that was supported by Villa and Zapata, but opposed by González and Obregón.ConstitutionalistandConventionforces battled until 1915, when Carranza’s adherents gained the upper hand and the Convention split into separate factions, some of which continued to fight the Constitutionalists for years. Carranza went on to call for anew constitution, to be based on the Liberal Constitution of 1857. The ensuingConstitution of 1917went far beyond the minor reforms that Carranza had envisioned, and promotedland redistribution,workers’ rights,anticlericalism, andnational ownership of Mexico’s natural resources. Over the next several years, Carranza proved reluctant to enact the 1917 constitution’s more radical provisions, or to give up control of the government. Obregón forced Carranza tofleethe capital in 1920, and likely had a role in Carranza’s subsequentassassination.",
    "Emiliano Zapata": "(1879–1919) andPancho Villa(born Doroteo Arango) (1878–1923) were both early supporters ofFrancisco Madero, opponents ofVictoriano Huerta, and leaders of theConvention forcesduring theMexican Revolution. Villa chiefly operated in northern Mexico, while Zapata was based in his home state,Morelos, south of Mexico City. In 1911 Villa andPascual Orozcoled Maderista forces at theBattle of Ciudad Juárez, while Zapata issued thePlan of Ayala, which called for the breakup of largehaciendasand the restoration of communal lands known asejidos. During Madero’s presidency Villa was imprisoned by Victoriano Huerta, who also conducted a brutal military campaign against the peasant supporters of Zapata. After Madero’s death, Villa joined Carranza’s army as the leader of theDivisión del Norte, or Division of the North, and Zapata established himself as the central leader of the varioussouthern guerrilla movements. At theConvention of Aguascalientes, Villa’s supporters sought to promote the rights of peasants and workers;Zapatistastook a less active role at the meeting, but were willing to support the Convention government in opposition to Carranza. In the subsequent fighting, Zapatista soldierstook the capitalseveral times but wereunable to hold itafter 1915, the same year that Villa suffered defeats at thebattles of CelayaandAgua Prieta. Zapata retreated to Morelos and carried out localland reformsas the Constitutionalists focused on defeating Villa, who sought to obtain supplies by carrying out a 1916raid on the American town of Columbus, New Mexico. In response to this incursion, the U.S. sent a“punitive expedition”led by GeneralJohn J. Pershingto (unsuccessfully) pursue Villa across northern Mexico. The influence of Villa and Zapata declined, and both were eventuallyassassinated. However, the two men remain symbols of the Revolution’s popular aspirations. Zapata in particular has served as an inspiration to later movements such as the Chiapas-based EZLN, orZapatista Army of National Liberation.",
    "Lázaro Cárdenas": "(1895–1970) was arevolutionary generalwho served aspresidentfrom 1934 to 1940, and who worked to fulfill the Constitution of 1917’s promises ofland reformandnationalizationof key resources. After Carranza’s death, Mexico was ruled by the“Sonoran dynasty”ofÁlvaro ObregónandPlutarco Elías Calles, who stabilized the country and implemented limited reforms. Calles also founded a forerunner of thePRI, or Institutional Party of the Revolution, which dominated Mexican politics throughout the 20th century. After stepping down as president, Calles continued to control Mexican politics from 1928 to 1934 during a period known as the“Maximato.”However, Cárdenas surprised Calles by turning against him, and forcing him into exile. As president, Cárdenas alsobroke up large estatesinto communalejidos, promotedorganized labor, andexpropriated foreign-owned oil fieldsin 1938 to form the national oil companyPemex, or Petróleos Mexicanos. These actions made Cárdenas very popular, but once he left office the Mexican government’s commitment to economic redistribution soon waned. In 1988 Lázaro’s sonCuauhtémoc Cárdenaschallenged PRI control of politics by running for president as the candidate of thePRD, or Party of the Democratic Revolution. Althoughelectoral fraudprevented Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas from winning, his challenge helped to bring about political changes that eventually ledVicente Foxof thePAN, or National Action Party, to be elected president in 2000."

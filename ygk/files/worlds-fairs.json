    "London, 1851: Great Exhibition”": "The Great Exhibition was the first ever “World’s Fair.” The event was largely organized byPrince Albertand was held in the“Crystal Palace,”a structure nearly three times larger than St. Paul’s Cathedral. Exhibitors includedSamuel Colt, who brought a prototype of his “Navy” pistol, andMathew Brady, a pioneer of daguerreotypes. A boating race held in conjunction with the exhibition was won by a ship calledAmerica, leading to its prize becoming known as theAmerica’s Cup. It also featured the world’s first modernpay toilets, which cost a penny to use. The Crystal Palace remained in use for decades after the event was over, but was destroyed by a fire in 1936.",
    "Paris, 1889: Exposition Universelle": "Although Paris had hosted the World’s Fair three times before, its 1889 event was easily its most iconic. It is best known for its centerpiece, theEiffel Tower, which was by far the tallest structure in the world when it was completed. Exhibits were placed throughout the Champ de Mars, including the“Streets of Cairo,”an elaborate interpretation of Egypt’s capital. Another of its most popular attractions was a“human zoo,”in which various indigenous and other non-white people were put on display, a practice that was largely accepted at the time. The Eiffel Tower was scheduled to be dismantled 20 years after the 1889 fair, but its usefulness in telegraphy led to those plans being scrapped.",
    "Chicago, 1893: World’s Columbian Exposition": "Chicago’s 1893 fair was nicknamed the “Columbian Exposition” to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s voyages to the “New World.” A massive pool representing Columbus’s voyage served as its centerpiece. Other debuts at the fair included the firstFerris Wheel, the first chocolatebrownies, and the first“squished penny” souvenirs. The event is also associated with multiple controversies. Chicago mayorCarter Harrisonwas assassinated during its final days, leading to the cancellation of the closing ceremony. Additionally, serial killerH. H. Holmesand his so-called “Murder Castle” are often tied to the fair, though their actual connection is likely minimal. Both the fair and the associated crimes are detailed in Erik Larson’s bookThe Devil in the White City.",
    "St. Louis, 1904: Louisiana Purchase Exposition": "The 1904 World’s Fair was held to honor the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. It saw the debut of theX-ray machineand inspired the popular song“Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis.”The fair featured daily re-enactments of battles from theSecond Boer War, many of which featured people who had actually fought in it. The1904 Summer Olympicshad been awarded to Chicago but were re-located to St. Louis so they could be held alongside the fair. That change led to very sparse attendance and poorly run events over the course of several months. NovelistKate Chopinsuffered a brain hemorrhage while visiting the 1904 fair and died two days later.",
    "Brussels, 1958": "The first full-scale world’s fair after World War II was held in Brussels in 1958. A lasting symbol of the Brussels fair is theAtomium, a 335-foot model of a unit cell of an iron crystal. The structure, which remains among the city’s most popular attractions, is approximately 165 billion times larger than the cell it represents. The fair also featured thePoème électronique, a piece of electronic music by Edgard Varèse played in a specialized pavilion designed by Le Corbusier. The first universal poll to rank the greatest films was held at the Brussels fair, which was topped by Sergei Eisenstein’sBattleship Potemkin.",
    "Seattle, 1962: Century 21": "Because of the ongoingspace race, Seattle’s fair had a strong focus on technology and aerospace. Structures built for the fair include theSpace Needleand amonorail, both of which are still standing today. Its “World of Science” building housed theProject Mercury capsulethat took Alan Shepard to space, and its “World of Century 21” building offered glimpses of “the future” of cities, cars, and air travel. John F. Kennedy intended to attend the closing of the fair, but was unable to because of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The fairgrounds, now known as the Seattle Center, has since become home to the Museum of Pop Culture.",
    "New York, 1964": "Like the Seattle fair two years earlier, the New York fair was themed around the burgeoningSpace Age, particularly with theUnisphere, a massive stainless-steel globe that served as a key symbol of the event. Pope John XXIII allowed Michelangelo’sPietàto be relocated to the fair’sVatican Pavilion. Elsewhere, Walt Disney designed several animatronic attractions for the fair, including his first incarnation of the“It’s a Small World”ride. While it is generally named for 1964, the fair had a second “season” the following year as well. A pair of observation towers left over from the fair provide a key plot point to the movieMen in Black.",
    "Montreal, 1967: Expo 67": "Montreal hosted one of the biggest world fairs in history and attracted over half a million visitors just days after opening. One highlight of the fair was the unveiling of Moshe Safdie’s“Habitat 67,”a complex of hundreds of interlocking concrete buildings intended as a model community. The U.S. Pavilion at the fair was ageodesic domedesigned by Buckminster Fuller, which was later converted into a museum called theBiosphere. In a notorious moment, French president Charles de Gaulle addressed a crowd in Montreal and declared“Long live a free Quebec!,”angering many Canadian politicians.",
    "Knoxville, 1982": "In contrast to larger “World Expos,” Knoxville held a “specialized” fair focused onenergy. Structures built for the event include theSunsphere, a 266-foot tower topped with a golden sphere. The fair also featured the debut of an early version of thetouch screenand the introduction ofCherry Coke. American sports were also featured during the event, with the NFL and NBA both hosting exhibition games at local venues. A fictional version of the Sunsphere had a prominent role in an episode ofThe Simpsons, in which it was converted into the “Wigsphere,” a shop for discount wigs.",
    "Dubai, 2020": "The most recent world fair was scheduled for Dubai in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it ultimately began in September 2021. The U.S. built a 36,000-square-foot pavilion for the fair, which featured artifacts likeThomas Jefferson’s copy of the Qur’anand a moon rock from the Apollo 17 mission. The fair also played host to the2021 World Chess Championship, which was won by defending champion Magnus Carlsen. Shortly before the fair began, the European Parliament formallyopposedthe event, citing the UAE’s human rights record, though it had little effect on attendance."

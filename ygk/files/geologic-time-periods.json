    "Hadean Eon": "The(4600 million years ago to 4000mya) stretches from the formation of the Earth to theformation of the oldest known rocks. The Hadean is so named because of its harsh conditions, such as intenseleftover heatfrom planetary accretion, theabsence of a stable atmosphere, and the frequency ofimpacts. Key events during the Hadean include theMoon’s formation(4500 mya), likely due to the impact of a small planet with the young Earth, and liquid waterocean formation(4400 mya).",
    "Archean Eon": "During the(4000 to 2500 mya), the Earth cooled enough for stable continents to form. There is contrasting evidence as to whether a period of increased impact events called theLate Heavy Bombardment(LHB, 4100 to 3900 mya) during the early Archean actually occurred. The Archean Eon also saw theemergence of life, the first definitive evidence of which comes fromstromatolites—fossilized microbial mats that formed in shallow coastal areas.",
    "Proterozoic Eon": "The(2500 mya to 541 mya) contained theGreat Oxidation Event(GOE, 2400 to 2000 mya), during which oxygen levels rose significantly due tooxygenic photosynthesisperformed bycyanobacteria. During the late Proterozoic, the Earth underwent multipleglaciation events, possibly even resulting in a fully frozen“Snowball Earth.”The last period of the Proterozoic Eon was the Ediacaran Period, during which the first knownmulticellular organismswith specialized tissues—mostly simple, sessile, and flat marine animals—evolved. The Proterozoic was followed by thePhanerozoic Eon—the current eon, characterized by the abundance of plant and animal life.",
    "Cambrian Period": "The(541 mya to 485 mya) is the first period of the Phanerozoic Eon andPaleozoic Era. The key event of the time period was theCambrian Explosion, during which almost all modern animal phyla appeared. The Cambrian Explosion is an example ofadaptive radiation, an event by which organisms rapidly evolve and diversify to take advantage of new resources or fill empty ecological niches. The cause of the Cambrian Explosion is unknown, but could be due to environmental changes or evolutionary breakthroughs such as eyes and/or animals that were exclusively predators. Evidence for the Cambrian explosion can be found in theBurgess Shale, a fossil deposit in British Columbia. This period also contained theCambrian Substrate Revolution, in which the evolution of burrowing animals allowed water and oxygen to penetrate deep into ocean sediments and permanently alter their chemistry.",
    "Ordovician Period": "The(485 mya to 444 mya) contained theGreat Ordovician Biodiversification Event. Invertebrates flourished, with marine filter-feeders dominating the shallow seas of the period. The Ordovician saw thefirst complex life on land, as plants colonized the continents. The end of this period was marked by theOrdovician Mass Extinction, the second largest mass extinction in Earth’s history, which killed around 85% of marine species. The mass extinction is thought to have been caused by the Late Ordovicianglaciation, which caused sea levels to fall and eliminated many of the shallow seas that housed most organisms of the time.",
    "Silurian Period": "The(444 mya to 419 mya) was much more stable and warm than the Ordovician. The Silurian saw theexpansion of terrestrial life.Vascular plants—which have specialized tissues containing lignin for transporting water and minerals—emerged, as well as terrestrialfungiand three groups of terrestrialarthropods: myriapods (centipedes and millipedes), arachnids (spiders), and hexapods (insects). Jaws and bones evolved for the first time in fish, which were beginning to rapidly diversify.",
    "Devonian Period": "The(419 mya to 359 mya) is sometimes known as theAge of Fishes, as they came to dominate marine environments. Some fish even moved beyond the ocean; during the Devonian, the ancestors of four-limbed vertebrates, or tetrapods, began to adapt to life on land as the firstamphibians. Land plants also underwent an adaptive radiation sometimes known as theDevonian Explosion, as evolutionary innovations including the first leaves, roots, and seeds allowed them to rapidly colonize swaths of dry land. These plants may have also indirectly caused theLate Devonian Mass Extinctionby absorbing huge quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide, leading to global cooling andmarine anoxia(low-oxygen conditions). The extinction primarily affected marine organisms; at least 75% of species went extinct, including almost all of the formerly dominant trilobites.",
    "Carboniferous Period": "The(359 mya to 299 mya) can be divided into two halves: theMississippian(359 mya to 331 mya), and thePennsylvanian(331 mya to 299 mya). The Carboniferous is named for the abundant coal deposits dated to that time. Receding seas led to the prevalence of lowlandswamps, which were filled with lignin-rich trees and numerous ferns. These extensive forests sequestered carbon dioxide, leading to anincrease in atmospheric oxygen levelsto about 35%, as compared to 21% today. High oxygen levels may have led togigantismin insects; millipedes grew to over 8 feet long and dragonflies had wingspans of 30 inches. The Carboniferous is also known as theAge of Amphibians, as tetrapods became the dominant terrestrial animals and began to diversify. The firstamniotesappeared, as well as the firstreptiles. Landmasses including the southern continent Gondwana and the northern continent Laurasia collided to form the supercontinentPangaea, which was surrounded by thePanthalassic Ocean.",
    "Permian Period": "The(299 mya to 252 mya) saw a decline of the swamps of and rainforests that dominated the Carboniferous and an increase indesertsthroughout the interior of Pangaea. Amniotes were able to cope with the prevalent dry climates, and two amniotic groups—thesynapsids(ancestors of modern mammals) andsauropsids(reptiles)—greatly diversified. The end of the Permian was marked by the Permian Mass Extinction (also known as theGreat Dying), the largest mass extinction in Earth’s history; over 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct. The extinction is thought to have been caused by an eruption of theSiberian Traps, a large igneous province that released massive amounts of lava and noxious gasses. The outgassing of carbon dioxide led to severeglobal warming,ocean acidification, andanoxia. All large synapsids went extinct, leaving an ecological void.",
    "Triassic Period": "The(252 mya to 201 mya) was the first period of theMesozoic Era. A specialized group of reptiles calledarchosaursunderwent adaptive radiation to fill the voids left by the Permian Mass Extinction. The dominant group of archosaurs was the pseudosuchians, ancestors of modern crocodiles. Another group of archosaurs, thedinosaurs, first appeared, as well as the first truemammals. The climate of the Triassic was hot and dry, but became humid as Pangaea began to break up near the end of the period. The period ended with theTriassic Mass Extinction, which wiped out about 75% of species. Marine invertebrates were hit particularly hard, but large pseudosuchians and amphibians also went extinct, paving the way for the rise of the dinosaurs.",
    "Jurassic Period": "The(201 mya to 145 mya) was the first to be dominated bydinosaurs. The climate waswarm; there were no ice caps and forests stretched to the poles. Many of the most well-known dinosaurs from the Jurassic Period are known from theMorrison Formationin Colorado, including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, Brontosaurus, Diplodocus, and Apatosaurus. Archaeopteryx, a transitional species between dinosaurs and birds, was discovered in the Jurassic-ageSolnhofen Limestonein Germany. The skies were ruled by flying reptiles calledpterosaurs, and the oceans were dominated by marine reptiles, including ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs.",
    "Cretaceous Period": "The(145 mya to 66 mya) was similar to the Jurassic. The climate was still warm, with numerous shallow inland seas.Dinosaurscontinued to dominate, and mammals and birds continued to diversify.Angiosperms, or flowering plants, appeared for the first time and quickly became the dominant group of plants on Earth. North America was split lengthwise by the Western Interior Seaway, which was dominated by marine reptiles called mosasaurs. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs that walked the land included Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor, and Triceratops. The Cretaceous Period, and the Mesozoic Era, ended with theCretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction. A worldwide layer ofiridiumdated to 66 mya sparked theÁlvarez Hypothesis, which posited that the extinction was caused by a huge impact event. This idea was strongly supported by the discovery of the massiveChicxulub crateron the Yucatán peninsula. 75% of all species went extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs and large terrestrial animals.",
    "Cenozoic Era": "The(66 mya to present) is the current era, sometimes known as theAge of Mammals. During the initial Paleogene Period (66 mya to 23 mya), mammals diversified and grew in size to become the dominant land animals, filling the void left by the previous mass extinction. Temperatures were high at the beginning of the period, peaking at thePaleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum(PETM), but cooled down during the Oligocene epoch as Antarctica froze. During the Neogene Period (23 mya to 2.6 mya), landmasses settled close to their modern positions. The current period is theQuaternary Period(2.6 mya to present). The period’s Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 mya to 11,700 ya) was marked bycyclical ice ages. It saw the evolution ofmegafaunaincluding mammoths, saber-tooth tigers, and giant sloths and armadillos, as well as the first appearance ofHomo sapiens. The current epoch is theHolocene epoch, which is characterized by the growth and impacts of the human species."

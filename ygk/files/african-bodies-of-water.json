    "Nile River": "Usually cited as thelongest river in the world, the Nile flows about 4,132 miles in a generally south-to-north direction from its headwaters inBurunditoEgypt’sMediterranean Seacoast, where it forms a prototypicaldelta.  Over 80% of the Nile’s flow comes from the shorterBlue Nileheadstream, which arises fromEthiopia’sLake Tanaand meets the longerWhite Nile— whose headwaters includeLake Victoria— atKhartoum.  At the first of the Nile’s six cataracts is theAswan High Dam, which formsLake Nasserand greatly reduces the annual floods.",
    "Congo River": "Africa’s second-longest river, it flows in a counterclockwise arc some 2,900 miles to the Atlantic Ocean.  The Upper Congo’s principal sources are theLualaba, which rises in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo’sKatangaprovince, andZambia’sChambeshi River.Boyoma Falls(formerlyStanley Falls), a section of seven cataracts nearKisangani, marks the beginning of the Congo River proper.  Forming theMalebo Poolnear the world capitals ofKinshasaandBrazzaville, the Lower Congo flows pastAngola’sCabindaexclave as it enters the ocean.Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darknessdepicts the often cruel conditions the Congo basin endured as aBelgiancolony.",
    "Zambezi River": "Weaving across southern Africa, the Zambezi rises in easternAngola, passes throughZambia, flows along the borders ofNamibia,Botswana, andZimbabwe, crosses throughMozambique, and enters theIndian Ocean’sMozambique ChannelnearChinde.  Namibia’sCaprivi Stripwas created to allow access to the Zambezi.  TheCabora BassaandKariba Damsform large lakes of the same name.  The most spectacular feature of the Zambezi isVictoria Falls, or Mosi-oa-Tunya (“the smoke that thunders”), which is over a mile wide and is the largest waterfall by flow rate in Africa.",
    "Niger River": "Africa’s third-longest, it flows in a great clockwise arc throughGuinea,Mali,Niger, andNigeriabefore entering theGulf of Guinea.  The medievalMaliandSonghai Empireswere centered on the Niger, whose course was mapped by the Scottish explorerMungo Parkin the 1790s.  In Nigeria, it receives theBenue River, its main tributary.  The massive Niger Delta, known for its fisheries, wildlife, and petroleum, is an area of increasing social unrest.",
    "Limpopo River": "Rising as theCrocodile(or Krokodil) River inSouth Africa’sWitwatersrandregion, it forms theTransvaal’s border withBotswanaandZimbabwe, then crosses throughMozambique.Deforestationin Mozambique contributed to massivefloodingof the Limpopo in 2000.  Perhaps the most famous description of the Limpopo comes fromRudyard Kipling, who in“The Elephant’s Child”referred to it as “the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees.”",
    "Okavango River": "The Okavango flows for about 1,000 miles from centralAngola, throughNamibia’sCaprivi Strip, and into theKalahari DesertofBotswana.  There, rather than flowing into the sea, it terminates in a massive inland swamp known as theOkavango Delta, an area that — especially during the wet season — teems with wildlife in an otherwise inhospitable region.",
    "Lake Victoria": "Africa’s largest and the world’s second-largest freshwater lake by area, Lake Victoria lies along theEquatorand is shared amongUganda,Kenya, andTanzania.  Located on a plateau between tworift valleys, its lone outlet is theVictoria Nile, a precursor of theWhite Nile.  Named by the British explorerJohn Hanning SpekeafterQueen Victoria, the introduction of the predatoryNile perchin the 1950s has caused environmental degradation, sending many nativecichlidspecies into extinction.",
    "Lake Tanganyika": "Africa’s second-largest lake by area, it is also the second-deepest in the world, surpassed only byLake Baikal.  Due its extreme depth (over 4,700 feet), Lake Tanganyika contains seven times as much water as Lake Victoria.  A source of theLualaba River, it is shared byTanzania, theDemocratic Republic of the Congo,Burundi, andZambia.  On its Tanzanian shore is the town ofUjiji, at whichHenry Morton Stanley“found”Dr. David Livingstonein 1871.",
    "Lake Malawi": "(orLake Nyasa) Africa’s third-largest lake by area and the southernmost of theGreat Rift Valleylakes, it is wedged between the nations ofMalawi,Tanzania, andMozambique.   Fed by theRuhuhu River, its lone outlet is theShire River, a tributary of theZambezi.  Lake Malawi contains hundreds of species of endemic fish, especiallycichlids.",
    "Lake Volta": "The largest man-made lake (by area) in the world, Lake Volta was created by the construction ofGhana’sAkosombo Damacross the Volta River in the 1960s.  The lake covers the area where theBlack VoltaandWhite Voltarivers formerly converged.  The Akosombo Dam can provide over a gigawatt of power, enough to supply nearby aluminum smelters utilizing the energy-intensiveHall-Héroult processand the needs of the rest of the country.",
    "Lake Chad": "Formerly Africa’s fourth-largest lake, its surface area has been reduced by over 90% since the 1960s due to droughts and diversion of water from such sources as theChari River.  The lake is at the intersection ofChad,Cameroon,Niger, andNigeria, but most of the remaining water is in Chad and Cameroon.  Lake Chad is very shallow and has no outlet, so seasonal rainfall causes large fluctuations in its area."

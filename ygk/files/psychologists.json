    "Ivan Pavlov": "(Russian 1849–1936): Ivan Pavlov was more of aphysiologistthan a psychologist, but questions about him are more often classified as psychology than biology by question writers.  He is largely remembered for his idea of theconditioned reflex, for example, thesalivationof adogat the sound of thebellthat presages dinner, even though the bell itself is inedible and hasno intrinsic connectionwith food.

Watson": "(American, 1878–1958): John Watson was the first prominent exponent ofbehaviorism; he codified its tenets inBehavior: An Introduction to Comparative Psychology, arguing that psychology could be completely grounded inobjective measurementsof events and physical human reactions.

    "Abraham Maslow": "(American, 1908–1970): Abraham Maslow is principally known for two works,Motivation and PersonalityandToward a Psychology of Being, that introduced his theory of thehierarchy of needs(food, shelter, love, esteem, etc.) and its pinnacle, the need forself-actualization.  Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value.  The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought.",
    "Stanley Milgram": "(American, 1933–1984): Though he did the work that created the idea of“six degrees of separation”and the“lost-letter” technique, he is mainly remembered for his experiments onobedience to authoritythat he performed at Yale in 1961–1962.  Milgram found that two thirds of his subjects were willing to administer terribleelectric shocksto innocent, protesting human beings simply because a researcher told them the experimental protocol demanded it."

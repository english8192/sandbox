    "Louis VIII": "(1187–1226, reigned 1223–1226; house ofCapet):  Though he reigned for onlythree years, Louis’ contributions to the rise of French power were enormous.  Heannexed Languedocandcaptured Poitoufrom England.  Perhaps more importantly, he established the systems ofappanages(land grants) which replaced the older, local nobles withbaronswho owed theirfiefsto the crown.  This allowed for the subsequent rise in French royal (and national) power.",

He also concludedalliances with Portugal,Spain, andFlanders,reorganized the army, andrestructured the collection of taxeswhile leading France’s recovery from the devastation of the early period of theHundred Years’ War.",
    "Charles VIII": "(1470–1498, reigned 1483–1498; house ofValois):  Charles’ short reign is remarkable for the enormous cost in men and money of hisItalian campaign, but more so for the number of his successors that followed his catastrophic lead.  Charles was motivated by a desire togovern Naples, which he had theoretically inherited.  He died before he could surpass or absolve his disastrous first campaign with another.",
    "Francis I": "(1494–1547, reigned 1515–1547; house ofValois): Francis’s early military victories (like theBattle of Marignano), hislavish court, and his support of luminaries likeLeonardo da Vinciaugured a splendid reign.

TheWar of the Three Henriesbroke out after his brother died and the then-ProtestantHenry of Navarre(laterHenry IV) became heir, leading theCatholic Holy Leagueto strike out of fear for its interests.

With the help ofMaximilien Sullyheerased the national debtand removed much of the religious strife with theEdict of Nantes(1598).",
    "Louis XIII": "(1601–1643, reigned 1610–1643; house ofBourbon):  Sometimes working with his chief ministerCardinal Richelieuand sometimes against, Louis XIII turned France into the pre-eminent European power during his reign.  This was largely achieved via French victories in theThirty Years’ War.The Three Musketeersis set in the early years of his reign.",
    "Louis XIV": "(1638–1715, reigned 1643–1715; house ofBourbon):  Louis XIV’s reign is often cited as the best historical example of anabsolute monarchy.

In 1863 it published an article about a slave namedGordonalong with a widely circulated photograph of his whipped, mutilated back that roused abolitionist sentiment across the North.George William Curtis, a co-founder of the Republican Party, was its political editor from 1863 to 1892, during which time he ran cartoons byThomas Nast, including Nast’s portrayals of Boss Tweed and the Tammany Hall political machine. (Although Nast’sHarper’s Weeklywork did popularize American symbols like Uncle Sam, Columbia, and the Democratic donkey, Nast was not the inventor of those symbols.)",

In 1862 it published Julia Ward Howe’s“The Battle Hymn of the Republic,”and in 1963 it published Martin Luther King Jr.’s“Letter from Birmingham Jail”for a nationwide audience. More recently, it ran Ta-Nehisi Coates’s 2014 article“The Case for Reparations,”which advocates reimbursing the descendants of American slaves. Despite its political emphasis, it has only ever endorsed three presidential candidates: Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.",
    "Puck": "(1871–1915) was a humor and satire magazine best remembered for its vivid political cartoons.

Rockefeller as a king with an hugecrown of railroads,Uncle Sam as a schoolteacherlooming over racist caricatures of its new territories, and Columbia admiring herbonnet of gunboatsin a mirror. (Puckshould not be confused withPunch, a British magazine of the same era also noted for its political cartoons.)",
    "McClure’s Magazine": "(1893–1929) was founded explicitly to publish the investigative journalism now known as“muckraking.”In 1901 its staff writer Ray Stannard Baker publishedWhat the U.S. Steel Corporation Really Is, and How It Works. In 1902 it ran Ida Tarbell’sThe History of the Standard Oil Company. Lincoln Steffens’s series on political machines,Tweed Days in St. Louis, was later compiled as the 1906 bookThe Shame of the Cities. Willa Cather helped write its highly skeptical 1909 biographyThe Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science.",
    "Cosmopolitan": "(1886–present) began as a classy, largely inoffensive magazine until 1965, whenHelen Gurley Brownbecame its editor and made it a women’s magazine geared towards fashion and romantic relationships. (Three years prior, Brown rose to fame for her popular, controversial non-fiction bookSex and the Single Girl.)Cosmopolitan’s new angle was viewed as misogynistic by most leading feminists; copies were burned alongsidePlayboyat protests against the1968 Miss America pageant. In 1989 it ran an article falsely stating heterosexual women cannot contract HIV, prompting protests from ACT UP and other gay organizations.",
    "Time": "(1923–present) was the U.S.’s first weekly newsmagazine. Its founder,Henry Luce, used its near-instant success to create a stable of influential magazines, includingLife,Fortune, andSports Illustrated. Since 1927 it has designated various figures as“Person of the Year”(originally “Man of the Year”), the first being Charles Lindbergh; controversial picks for the award include Adolf Hitler in 1938 and Joseph Stalin in both 1939 and 1942. In June 1994,Timewas criticized for darkening themugshot of O. J. Simpsonon its cover, especially juxtaposed againstNewsweek’s largely undoctored version on their cover the same month. After 9/11,Time’s cover showed the second plane flying into the Twin Towers and used a black border in place of its iconicred border.",
    "National Review": "(1955–present) was founded by the foremost leader of the American conservative movement in the 20th century,William F. Buckley Jr., and aimed from its outset to define and promoteright-wing thought. Its earliest editors were staunch anti-Communists likeWhittaker Chambers. Under Buckley,National Reviewexpanded conservatism’s allies to include libertarians while disavowing anti-Semitic and nativist elements, such as the John Birch Society. After Barry Goldwater’s defeat in 1964,National Reviewrallied conservatism behind the up-and-comingRonald Reagan. Buckley parlayed his success withNational Reviewinto hosting PBS’sFiring Linefrom 1966 to 1999.",
    "Rolling Stone": "(1967–present) was founded in San Francisco as a rock and roll magazine, but it quickly became notable for its experimental political journalism. In 1970 the magazine won acclaim for its pieces on the tragicAltamont Free Concertand onCharles Mansonwhile he was in jail awaiting trial. The magazine is indelibly associated with the gonzo journalism ofHunter S. Thompson—his seminal novelFear and Loathing in Las Vegasand the political pieceFear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ’72first appeared in Rolling Stone. After becoming more Hollywood-geared in the 1990s, in the 2000s it re-oriented itself towards politics. In 2014 it generated public outcry over its allegedly “glamorizing” cover photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers.",

    "“The Second Coming”": "(1920) is a poem by William Butler Yeats that uses apocalyptic imagery to describepost-World War I Europe, which at the time was also gripped by a deadly flu pandemic. The poem opens by stating “Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; /Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.” Yeats further notes “Surely some revelation is at hand; / Surely the Second Coming is at hand” and concludes the poem by asking “what rough beast, its hour come round at last, / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?” Chinua Achebe used a line from Yeats’s poem to title his novelThings Fall Apart."

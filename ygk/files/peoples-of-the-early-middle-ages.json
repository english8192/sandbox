    "Huns": "In the late fourth century, theentered central Europe from thesteppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas. Historians disagree on what, if any, components of the Hunnic advance should be identified with theXiongnu, a confederation of Central Asian nomads that fought against Han China before being dispersed in the third century. The Roman historianAmmianus Marcellinuswrote that they inflicted“tremendous slaughter” on Germanic and Roman enemiesalike. Their great leader,Attila— known as the“scourge of God”— was defeated at theCatalaunian Fields(nearChalonsin what is now northern France) by analliance of Romans and Visigoths. After Attila’s death in 453, arebellion of Germanic subject peoplesbroke up the Hunnic empire.",
    "Visigoths": "Thewere one of a number of Germanic peoplesscattered by the advance of the Huns. They took refuge south of the Danube under theprotection of the Roman Empire. When that “protection” was revealed to consist ofabuse,fraud, andstarvation, theyrebelledand caused disorder in Rome’sBalkan provinces. When the emperorValenssent in the army to restore order, Goths — led byFritigern— shattered the Roman army atAdrianople(378), where Valens was killed. For the next forty years, groups of Visigothswandered the Roman worldsearching for a place to settle. In 410 Visigoths led byAlaricsacked Romeitself. By the middle of the fifth century, the Visigoths had settled insouthern Gaul(the “kingdom of Toulouse”) and theIberian peninsula. Christians among the Visigoths, like those among their Ostrogothic and Vandalic neighbors, subscribed to theheretical “Arian”beliefs, which caused conflict with their Roman subjects until the Visigothickings convertedat a 589 church council. Driven out of southern Gaul by the hostileFranks, the Visigoths retained control over most of what is now Spain until their kingRodericwaskilled by Islamic invadersfrom North Africa in 711.",
    "Ostrogoths": "When the Visigoths fled into the Roman empire, thewere one of numerousGermanic peoplessubjected to the Huns north of the Danube. Theythrew off Hunnic dominationafter the death of Attila. After the last Roman emperor of the west,Romulus Augustulus, wasdeposedin 476, the Ostrogoths took advantage of the chaos tooccupy Italyand establish their own kingdom. Their kingTheodoric, known as “the Great,” ruled from 493 to 526 and tried to restore peace to Italy.  The philosopherBoethiusworked as an official at Theodoric’s court. The Ostrogothic kingdomcollapsedin the 6th century after the Byzantine generalsBelisariusandNarsesfought a series of destructivewars for control of the Italian peninsula.",
    "Vandals": "Thewere one of several peoples whocrossed the frozen Rhine Riverinto RomanGaulon New Years’ Eve, 406. From Gaul they moved intoSpainand across the Strait of Gibraltar to attackRoman Africa. By 439 the Vandals had occupiedCarthage, gaining control of thegrain tradeand possession of a substantialnavy. This they used to embark on a second career asMediterranean pirates; theirsack of Romein 455 underKing Gaisericwas reputedly much more destructive than the Visigothic one 45 years earlier. The ravages of the Vandals so dismayed Roman observers that“vandalism”still indicates senselessly destructive behavior. Like the Ostrogoths, the Vandals were targets of the Byzantine emperorJustinian’s attemptedreconquestof the western Mediterranean; Justinian’s generalBelisariussmashed the Vandal army atTricamerumin December 533.",
    "Lombards": "Themoved into northern Italy (the region still known today as“Lombardy”) after the peninsula had been devastated by thewar between the Byzantines and the Ostrogoths. Lombard dukes and kings sharedcontrol of Italywith the remainingByzantinegarrisons. Although the Lombards wereCatholics, their relationship with the papacy was often turbulent. Papal requests for assistance led to the 8th-centuryinvasion by Frankish forcesunderCharlemagne, who crushed the Lombard kingdom and seized the Lombards’“iron crown.”The Lombard historianPaul the Deaconretired to the abbey of Monte Cassino to write a chronicle of his now-vanquished people.",
    "Franks": "Thesettled inGaullate in the 5th century, displacing the Roman official Syagrius.Clovis, the first great ruler of theirMerovingian dynasty, converted to (Catholic)Christianityin 496. The close association between the Franks and thepapacybenefited both parties in an age when their mutual enemies (such as theVisigoths) were either heretics or still pagan. Merovingian Gaul was wracked by civil war among contending Frankish kings; by the beginning of the 8th century the Merovingians had lost effective power to their chief ministers, the“mayors of the palace.”In 751 mayorPepin the Short, with permission from the pope, deposed the last Merovingian and established a newCarolingian dynastyof Frankish kings. Pepin’s son wasCharlemagne, who subjugated much of western Europe and presided over arevival of learningknown as the“Carolingian Renaissance.”On Christmas Day 800 Charlemagne was crownedemperorin Rome. Charlemagne’s grandsons quarreled over rights to his inheritance,splitting the Frankish empireinto a cluster of regional domains. The westernmost (“West Francia”) became the kingdom of France; the eastern one beyond the Rhine (“East Francia”) retained the imperial title as theHoly Roman Empire.",
    "Picts": "The, the early medieval inhabitants ofnorthern Britain, were known for theirraidson the Roman frontier fortificationHadrian’s Wall. Their name (from the Latinpictus, “painted”) may refer to their use ofcolorful tattoos. Pictish art is notable for elaboratestone carvingsof mysterious beasts. Starting in the 9th century, the Pictish kingdoms were absorbed by the neighboring kingdom of theScots.",
    "“Anglo-Saxons”": "is the conventional designation for a group ofGermanic peoples(primarily Angles, Saxons, andJutes) who migrated fromnorthwestern Europe(the North Sea coast of Germany and mainland Denmark) toBritainin the 5th and 6th centuries.  The Anglo-Saxon settlersconqueredor displaced the Roman and British inhabitants of the island (the semilegendaryKing Arthuris portrayed as a British ruler fighting against Saxon expansion). By the early 7th century, seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms across southern and eastern Britain were known collectively as theHeptarchy(a group of seven rulers).Christian missionariesarrived from Italy and Ireland to convert the pagan Anglo-Saxons. Cultural products of the newly Christian kingdoms includedilluminated manuscripts; the writings of the monastic historian theVenerable Bede, and the epic poemBeowulf. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were hard-hit by theViking raidsof the 9th century; onlyWessex, the southwesternmost kingdom, survived and repelled the Scandinavian raiders. The kings of Wessex thenunified the Anglo-Saxon territories as a single kingdom of England.",
    "Magyars": "The, like the Huns, were anomadic people of central Asia. Their language isUgric, related to Finnish and a number of west Siberian languages. Magyars occupied theDanube basinshortly before 900. They exploited thedecline of the Carolingian empireto carry outraidsonEast FranciaandItaly. The 955Battle of Lechfeld, won by Germany’sOtto the Great,halted their expansioninto central Europe. At the end of the 10th century, the Magyar grand prince wasbaptizedwith the nameStephenand crowned thefirst king of Hungary.",
    "Vikings": "(alternatively:NorsemenorNorthmen) wereseaborne raidersfromScandinaviawho usedlongshipsto attack coastal regions of western Europe between the late 8th and 11th centuries. Although they are best known forpillaging English and Irish monasteries, Vikings also settled and traded on waterways all over northern and eastern Europe, founding cities inRussiaand making voyages toIceland,Greenland, and theNew World. Vikings who seized part of northern France fromCharlemagne’s heirs established the duchy ofNormandy. During the 11th century,Normansfought as mercenaries andbuilt castlesinSicily,southern Italy,France, andBritain. NormanDuke Williamearned the epithet “the Conqueror” for his victory over the Anglo-Saxons at the 1066Battle of Hastings."

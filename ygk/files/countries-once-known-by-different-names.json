In 1947, thepartition of British Indiacreated the new countries of India and Pakistan, based on the majority religion of various areas. The new Dominion of Pakistan consisted of the areas whereIslamwas the majority religion, and was split into two separate exclaves:West Pakistan, consisting of what is now Pakistan; andEast Pakistan, covering what is now Bangladesh and consisting mostly of ethnicBengalipeople. In 1966Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, then head of East Pakistan’sAwami League, launched a major push for greater autonomy.

A 1983 coup d’état brought military officerThomas Sankarato power; the year after his ascent, he changed the country’s name to “Burkina Faso,” which roughly translates as“land of the upright”in two native tongues.

The name “Zaire” was derived from the Portuguese word for theCongo River, which itself was derived from a Bantu-language name for the river.

    "Ghana": "is a nation of former British holdings on Africa’s west coast, the most prominent of which was theGold Coast. The Gold Coast was so named by multiple European powers for the richgold reservesfound within the area; in time, the region also became heavily involved in theslave trade. Britain incorporated itsGold Coast Colonyin 1821 after seizing the chartered lands of theAfrican Company of Merchants, which had continued to trade in slaves after Britain had outlawed the trade in 1807; Britain subsequently subsumed other nations’s holdings in the region into the British Gold Coast. The modern push for independence began in the late 1940s, and was led byKwame Nkrumah, who later served as Ghana’s first prime minister and first president. Britain combined its Gold Coast,Northern Territories,Ashanti, andTogolandcolonies into a single entity, which became the Dominion of Ghana in 1957. Ghana became a fully independent republic in 1960.",
    "North Macedonia": "officially became known as such in February 2019. For over two decades, the country’s former name,Macedoniahad been the subject of a dispute withGreece, which objected to the use of the name “Macedonia” due both to the name’s ties to the ancientKingdom of Macedon, and the fact that Greece itself contains an administrative region named “Macedonia.” For many years, the country was referred to in the United Nations as theFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)due to the Greek objection, which also prevented Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO. The countries agreed to resolve the naming dispute in the 2018Treaty of Prespa.",

Portuguese explorers began using the term “Siam” to refer to the region in the 1500s; such usage gained official prominence via its use by rulers from theChakri dynasty. A rebellion and monarchical crisis in the 1930s led to the 1938 rise ofLuang Phibunsongkhram, commonly known asPhibun. In 1939 Phibun officially changed the country’s name to Thailand, orPrathet Thai, having a double meaning of “Land of the Thai” and “Land of the Free”—part of Phibun’s campaign against China. Phibun allied with the Japanese during World War II but was forced out of power in 1944. In 1945, the country’s post-war government changed the nation’s name back to Siam; however, another monarchical crisis sparked by the 1946 assassination ofRama VIIIled to Phidun’s return to power in 1948 with U.S. support.

These states lay along what Britain termed the“Pirate Coast”of the Persian Gulf; the treaties were intended to protect British ships from raids.

In 1968, Britain announced it would withdraw military support from the region.Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the emir ofAbu Dhabi, negotiated an agreement among the Trucial States to join together and became the first president of the United Arab Emirates when it was established in December 1971.",
    "Zimbabwe": "assumed its current name upon its formal independence from Britain in 1980 and was named after the ruined city ofGreat Zimbabwewithin its borders. Zimbabwe grew out of the colony ofRhodesia, named forCecil Rhodes, which Britain established in southern Africa in the late 19th century. That colony was later split along theZambezi RiverintoNorthern Rhodesia(which later became the country ofZambia) andSouthern Rhodesia. Southern Rhodesia’s white government attempted to declare independence from Britain in 1965 (as simply “Rhodesia”) in an effort to suppress the country’s black population, leading to the 15-year-longRhodesian Bush War. Under the 1979Lancaster House Agreement, Britain resumed control long enough to oversee elections that were won by theZANU party, led byRobert Mugabe, who ruled the new country for the next 37 years."

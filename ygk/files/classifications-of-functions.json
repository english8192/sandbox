    "Polynomials": "are functions made oftermsadded together, in which each term is a number times a product of variables raised to nonnegative-integer powers.  For instance, 3x2yand –πx7y2z3are each terms, so 3x2y– πx7y2z3is a polynomial.  (Individual terms are also considered polynomials.)  Much of math is concerned with polynomials involving only one variable, such as –x3+ 2x2.  The number at the beginning of each term is called acoefficient.Since simple numbers (“constants”) can also be written as the same number times any variable to the zeroth power (that is, 6 is the same as 6x0), numbers are also considered terms and polynomials.  Sox+ 6 is a polynomial, as is just –4.Polynomials can be classified according to their number of terms: a polynomial with one term, like 2xor –12x2, is called amonomial; a polynomial with two terms is called abinomial; and a polynomial with three terms is called atrinomial.Each polynomial has adegree.  For polynomials of one variable, the degree is the largest exponent on the variable, so for the polynomial 4x3–x2, the degree is 3.  For polynomials of multiple variables, to find the degree you calculate the sum of the variables’ exponents on each term, then choose the largest such sum, so the degree of 3x6y5–x2y3is calculated by adding 6+5 = 11 for the first term and 2+3 = 5 for the second and noting that 11 is larger, so the degree is 11.  A polynomial that is just a constant has degree 0.  A polynomial with degree 1, like 3x, is calledlinear; a polynomial with degree 2, like 3x2– 8x + 4, is calledquadratic; a polynomial with degree 3 is calledcubic; continuing with increasing degrees, the terms arequartic,quintic,sextic, and so on, though terms corresponding to degrees larger than 5 are seldom used.  For technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, the zero polynomial (i.e.,f(x) = 0) is said to have a degree of –∞ or an undefined degree.Thefundamental theorem of algebrais the statement that every single-variable polynomial, other than constants, has a root in the complex numbers, which means that iff(x) is a polynomial, then the equationf(x) = 0 has at least one solution wherexis some complex number.There are formulas to find those roots for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials, though the latter two formulas are extremely complicated.  TheAbel-Ruffini theorem, also calledAbel’s impossibility theorem, is the statement that there is no way to find a formula for the solutions of all quintic or higher-degree polynomials, if the formula must be based on the traditional operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and exponentiation/taking roots).  That impossibility is the topic that began an area of study calledGaloisgal-wahtheory, which is part of abstract algebra.",
    "Quadratics": "are, as mentioned above, polynomials of degree 2.  The graph of a quadratic equation will be in the shape of aparabolathat opens straight up (if the coefficient on thex2term is positive) or straight down (if that coefficient is negative).  It is possible to find the roots of a quadratic by graphing it, factoring it,completing the squareon it, or using thequadratic formula(itself derived by completing the square) on it.  If the quadratic is in the formax2+bx+c, then the expressionb2– 4ac, which appears in the quadratic formula, is called thediscriminant.  If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic will have two real roots; if the discriminant is zero, the quadratic will have one real root (said to have amultiplicityof 2); and if the discriminant is negative, the quadratic will have two non-real complex roots (and if the coefficients of the quadratic are real numbers, the complex roots will beconjugatesof each other).",
    "Rational functions": "consist of one polynomial divided by another polynomial.  The denominator polynomial cannot be the zero polynomial, because dividing by zero is undefined. Examples therefore include 1/x,x2/(x– 3), and (x2+ 1)/(x2– 1).  Every polynomial can be considered to be a rational function because 1 is a polynomial and dividing by 1 doesn’t change an expression (so to consider the polynomialx3as a rational function, think of it asx3/1).  It is often instructive to study theasymptotesof rational functions, which are places in which their graphs approach a line (or occasionally other shape), usually getting infinitely close to but not crossing it.  That analysis may require performinglong divisionon the numerator and denominator polynomials to find theirgreatest common factor.",
    "Periodic functions": "are those whose graph repeats a pattern (specifically, the graph hastranslational symmetry).  Technically speaking, a function of one variablefis periodic iff(x+p) =f(x) for everyxin the domain of the function and some positive numberp, which is called theperiod, because the graph repeats itself everypunits.  While the trigonometric functions are the periodic functions most commonly encountered by high school math students, some other functions like triangle waves are also periodic; in general, functions representing waves tend to be periodic.  AFourierfur-ee-ayseriesis a way to rewrite (almost) any periodic function in terms of only sine and cosine functions.",
    "trigonometric functions": "Therepresent relations between angles and sides of triangles.  They are often illustrated using points and segments related to a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, called theunit circle.  By far the most commonly discussed trigonometric functions are thesine,cosine,tangent,cosecant,secant, andcotangentfunctions.  There aremanyinteresting relationships between these: the graphs of sine and cosine are translations of each other; the tangent function equals the sine function divided by the cosine function; the cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, respectively; and there are many other relationships calledtrigonometric identities.",
    "inverse trigonometric functions": "Theare, as one might expect, theinverse functionsof the trigonometric functions.  (Note that “inverse” in this case refers to a function that “undoes” another, not to “multiplicative inverse,” also called “reciprocal.”)  They are sometimes just called “inverse sine,” etc, and are also given with the prefix “arc”:arcsine,arccosine,arctangent,arccosecant,arcsecant, andarccotangent.  They are sometimes notated in the form sin–1for arcsine, but that notation can be confusing, so NAQT tends to prefer “arcsine,” etc.  Because the trigonometric functions are not bijective (see below), to have inverses it is necessary to restrict the domains of the inverse trigonometric functions; for instance, arcsin(x) is only defined forxbetween –1 and 1, inclusive.",
    "Injective functions": ", orinjections, are functions that do not repeat any outputs.  For instance,f(x) = 2xis injective, because for every possible output value, there is only one input that will result in that output.  On the other hand,f(x) = sin(x) isnotinjective, because (for instance) the output 0 can be obtained from several different inputs (0, π, 2π, and so on).  If you have the graph of a function, you can determine whether the function is injective by applying thehorizontal line test:  if no horizontal line would ever intersect the graph twice, the function is injective.Surjective functions, orsurjections, are functions that achieve every possible output.  For instance, if you are thinking of functions whose domain and codomain are both the set of all real numbers, thenf(x) = tan(x) is surjective, because every real number is an output for some input.  Butf(x) =x2is not surjective, because (for instance) –3 is not an output for any real-number input.  The termimageis sometimes used for the set of all output values that a function actually achieves; a surjective function, then, is one whose image equals its codomain.A function that is both injective and surjective is calledbijective, or abijection.  If a function is bijective, then it has aninverse.  Furthermore, a function canonlyhave an inverse if it is bijective.",
    "Even functions": "satisfy the rulef(–x) =f(x) for everyxin the domain of the function.  The graph of an even function has reflection symmetry over they-axis.  Even functions are so named because if a polynomial’s exponents (on the variable) are all even, then the polynomial is an even function; for instance,x2, 3x6, and –x8+ 7x4are all even.  There are other even functions, though, such as the cosine and absolute value functions.Odd functionssatisfy the rulef(–x) = –f(x) for everyxin the domain of the function.  The graph of an odd function remains the same when it is rotated 180° around the origin.  Odd functions are so named because if a polynomial’s exponents (on the variable) are all odd, then the polynomial is an odd function; for instance,x3, 4x7, and –x5+ 2x3are all odd.  There are other odd functions, such as the sine and cube root functions.Many functions are neither even nor odd, such asx2+x.  Only one function is both even and odd: the zero function,f(x) = 0.",
    "Exponential functions": "are those of the formf(x) =bx, whereb(called the base) is a positive number other than 1. Exponential functions are used to model unrestrictedgrowth(such ascompound interest, and animalpopulationswith unlimited food and no predators) anddecay(such asradioactive decay).  The phrase “theexponential function” refers to the functionf(x) =ex, whereeis a specific irrational number calledEuler’s number, about equal to 2.718.  Exponential functions have the interesting property that theirderivativesare proportional to themselves.",
    "Logarithmic functions": ", orlogarithms, are functions of the formf(x) = logbx, wherebis again a positive number other than 1 (and again called the base).  They are the inverses of the exponential functions with the same bases.  Logarithmic functions are used to modelsensory perceptionand some phenomena in probability and statistics.  The phrase “thelogarithm” can refer to a logarithmic function using thebase 2(especially in computer science; this is also called thebinary logarithm),e(especially in higher math), or 10 (especially in lower levels of math and physical sciences). The phrasenatural logarithmrefers to the logarithm basee, and the phrasecommon logarithmusually refers to the logarithm base 10.",
    "Continuous functions": ", studied in calculus, are functions where thelimitapproaching each point equals the function’s value at that point.  In particular, there are noholes,jumps, orasymptotes“in the middle of the graph.”  Continuity is really a property of a specific point; a continuous function is a function that is continuous at every point.  Continuity is often explained as a function’s graph being drawable in one motion without lifting the writing utensil from the paper.  All polynomials are continuous, as are the sine and cosine functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and theabsolute value function.  Some examples of non-continuous functions are many rational functions, as they often have holes or asymptotes; the tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions, which have asymptotes; and thefloor and ceiling functions, which have jumps.",
    "Differentiable functions": ", also studied in calculus, are functions for which the derivative can be found (because a particular limit, called adifference quotient, exists).  Like continuity, differentiability is really a property of a specific point, and a differentiable function is one that is differentiable at every point.  Every differentiable function is continuous, but some continuous functions are not differentiable; mathematicians thus say that differentiability is a stronger property than continuity.  In terms of graphs, a differentiable function has a “smooth” graph with nocornersorcusps(and also, because continuity is required, no holes, jumps, or asymptotes).  All polynomials are differentiable, as are the sine and cosine functions, and exponential and logarithmic functions.  However, the absolute value functionf(x) = |x| is not differentiable because it has a “corner” atx= 0 (but recall that it is still continuous)."

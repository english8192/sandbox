    "The Great Plague of Athens": "struck Greece in 430 BC, during thePeloponnesian War. According to the historianThucydides, the disease spread to Athens from Ethiopia and killed up to 25% of the city’s population, including its leading statesman,Pericles. Though the illness spread to other cities, its particular impact on Athens helpedSpartabecome the foremost city in Greece. The cause of the plague remains unknown; historians have speculated that it may have beentyphusor an unknown type ofhemorrhagic fever.",
    "The Antonine Plague": "spread across theRoman Empirefrom AD 165 to 180. Roman troops brought the disease into the Mediterranean world after returning from war againstParthiainMesopotamia. The outbreak is named for theAntonine dynasty, which ruled Rome at the time under co-emperorsMarcus AureliusandLucius Verus(the latter of whom likely died of the plague); the dynasty’s founder,Antoninus Pius, had died in AD 161. The physicianGalenwrote detailed accounts of the outbreak, which allowed modern scholars to determine that the plague was likely eithersmallpoxormeasles.",
    "The Plague of Justinian": "is a common name for thefirst plague pandemicthat swept Europe and Asia beginning during the 540s. The plague struckConstantinopleduring the reign ofJustinian I, who was attempting to reassert Roman control over the Mediterranean. It was caused by the bacteriumYersinia pestis, the same agent that later caused theBlack Death. The plague and its many recurrences devastatedByzantiumand neighboring countries like theSassanid Empire; their weakened states helped enable theMuslim conquestsin the 7th century.",
    "The Black Death": "is a common name for thesecond plague pandemicwhich spread in themid-14th century.Mongolforces likely introduced the plague to Europe while besieging theGenoese colony of Kaffain Crimea. Over the following decade, the disease killed roughly half of the continent’s population. It also sparked major social disruptions, includingpeasant revoltsin England and France and massanti-semitism, due to many blaming the plague on Jews. The frame story for Giovanni Boccaccio’sDecameroninvolves ten people fleeing the plague in Florence. Scattered plague outbreaks continued across Europe for the next 300 years, including theGreat Plague of Londonin 1665. It is likely thedeadliestpandemic ever.",
    "Syphilis": ", asexually transmitted disease, spread across Europe beginning in the 1490s. While its origins are disputed, many Renaissance and contemporary scholars believe it came to Europefrom the Americasafter Christopher Columbus’s voyages. It was first described amongFrench troops invading Naplesin 1495 and known then as the“great pox.”Syphilis remained a major public health threat in the western world until the introduction ofpenicillinin the 1940s. In the 20th century, the U.S. government conducted a study inTuskegee, Alabamathat involved intentionally and inhumanely not treating hundreds ofBlack meninfected with the disease.",
    "Typhus": ", an infectious fever carried bylice, spread across Europe in the late 1400s. While it may have been responsible for ancient pandemics, typhus was first conclusively identified amongSpanish troopsattacking Granada near the end of theReconquista(15th century). Later typhus epidemics often coincided with military conflicts, for instance, causing most of the deaths during theThirty Years’ WarandNapoleon’s invasion of Russia. Typhus killed many victims of theHolocaust, includingAnne Frank.",
    "Smallpox": ", a disease caused by thevariolavirus, circulated as early as 1500 BC. While the disease becameendemicacross Europe and Asia, it caused devastation when introduced to new populations. Smallpox came to the Americas throughSpanish conquistadors, causing millions of deaths among indigenous civilizations like theAztecsandIncas. Later colonial efforts caused the disease to reach and decimateAboriginal Australiansand other native peoples. Chinese doctors developed strategies for inoculating against smallpox in the 1500s, whileEdward Jennercreated thefirst ever vaccineto prevent it in 1796 using the similarcowpoxvirus. A successful 20th-century campaign by the World Health organization led to theeradicationof smallpox in 1980.",
    "Cholera": "is anintestinalinfection that originated in India. Largely as a consequence ofBritish colonialism, cholera swept the globe during six pandemics in the 19th century. In the U.S. the disease killed former president James Polk and caused many deaths along theOregon Trail. While studying cholera in London, epidemiologistJohn Snowrecognized theBroad Street pumpas the common link in an outbreak and concluded that the disease was water-borne. Though now less fatal due to available treatments, cholera persists in large parts of the world; it killed over 10,000 people during a 2010s outbreak inHaiti.",
    "The Spanish Flu pandemic": "killed up to 100 million people from 1918 to 1920. Caused by theH1N1strain of influenza, the disease was first documented in aU.S. army camp in Kansas. It acquired its misleading name because Spain was one of the few countries not to censor information about it amidWorld War I, a conflict that drove the disease’s spread. Because Spanish flu often causedcytokine stormsin its victims, it disproportionately affected younger people. Notable victims of the pandemic includedGustav KlimtandMax Weber.",
    "AIDS": ", a condition caused byHIV(the human immunodeficiency virus), triggered a pandemic beginning in 1981. Originating inmonkeys, the virus jumped to humans in the early 20th century but did not spread widely until decades later. It is primarilysexually transmittedand devastatedgay communitiesacross the world in the 1980s and ’90s, largely due to intentional government inaction. The AIDS epidemic has also devastatedsub-Saharan Africa; a 2013 study estimated that nearly 80% of all people currently living with HIV were from southern Africa. Gay journalistRandy Shiltschronicled the early pandemic and government indifference in his bookAnd the Band Played On; he later died of AIDS himself. Public awareness of HIV/AIDS increased as it killed celebrities likeRock Hudson. The introduction of the drugAZTin 1987, later accompanied by other drugs, slowly helped reduce the disease’s mortality rate from nearly 100%. The pandemic spurred many works of art and literature, including the playAngels in Americaand the massiveAIDS Memorial Quilt."
